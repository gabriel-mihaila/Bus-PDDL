# Bus-PDDL
This problem is aimed at planning a trip with a means of public transport, such as the bus using PDDL. Passengers will board certain stations, travel to the desired destination, and then disembark. The goal of the main thing is to create an optimal travel plan so that the bus can cover minimum distances between the destinations desired by the passengers.
